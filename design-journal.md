Design journal for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1 
------
In our first week on the course we looked at the program [Atom](https://atom.io) and were told to familiarise ourselves with markdown and the syntax for it. To do this we were asked to render a text file in markdown using the Atom program. This was different as I have always used HTML to write code but using markdown was alot easier to do.
