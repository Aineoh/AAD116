Design journal for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1 
------
This week we had a broad look at the module and what will be covered in this semester. We looked at how past designs have influence the designs of today. For example [Dieter Rams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams) developed product designs for radios in 1950's which influenced [Jonathon Ive's](https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html)  design for the Ipod. I research this when I left the lecture and found a video called [Everything is a Remix](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/) which shows the history of how everything from music to cinematography is influence by the past. 

We were told about [Refresh](http://refreshbelfast.com) which is in Belfast and a talk is being given by [Brendan Dawes](http://brendandawes.com)

One of our projects for this semester is to design a type tile 3x3 grid of different typefaces from different periods in history that have appealed to me. This is part of our submission for this module. I'm excited for this project as I really enjoy typography and love finding new and old typefaces. When we have collected our images we should have something that looks like this:

In our first week on the course we looked at the program [Atom](https://atom.io) and were told to familiarise ourselves with markdown and the syntax for it. To do this we were asked to render a text file in markdown using the Atom program. This was different as I have always used HTML to write code but using markdown was alot easier to do.

Week 2
------
We started this lecture by looking at cave paintings and early written language. We looked at the earliest markings at Cantabria and how the oldest known marking is a simple red dot. This relates to the work we are doing in our modules of interaction design fundamentals which we are learning about points. We learned how cave drawings were inspiration for artists such as Picasso. They also remind me of the work of [Basquiat](http://basquiat.com). 

![basquiat](http://i.imgur.com/igeOg8z.jpg)

We learned about the [golden ratio](http://www.creativebloq.com/design/designers-guide-golden-ratio-12121546) and how its used in everything from [architecture](http://www.goldennumber.net/architecture/) to [nature](http://io9.com/5985588/15-uncanny-examples-of-the-golden-ratio-in-nature). We learned how it can be used in design with web design and layout which provides a natural and eye catching result. I found a website that helps you discover the perfect type size for your website using the measurments and calculations of the golden ratio. This will come in useful for designing websites in the future and also for project layouts.

This week we also finished up a homework assignment on markdown. We were given a piece of text and told to use a program called [Atom](https://atom.io) to render it. This was my finished assignment: 


###Ireland's rugged coastline###

Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
=======================================

###by Robert St'enuit###

####*Illustrations by National Geographic Photographer Bates Lilttlehales*####


A wild north wind lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of 
Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled 
in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to 
starboard.


>'93In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada, the Girona was wrecked with the loss
  of almost all her company at a little cove near the Giants Causeway still 
  called Port na Spaniagh, '91the port of the Spaniards'

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the
  vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles 
  and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an 
  escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with 
  flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.
  
The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the 
lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising
  from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back
  broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, 
  small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, 
  sank into the convulsive surf. 
  
**Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, 
treasures lost on that fateful day included:**

* A ornamental winged salamander 
* Gold cross of the Knight of Malta 
* Gilded brass dolphin 
* Lapis lazuli cameos 
* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face. 
* Gold ducats


**The Author:** Veteran Belgin dicer Robert St'enuit spent two days at 432 feet 
beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in **'93The Deepest Days'94**, National Geographic, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.


I also looked at [contrast through scale](http://typecast.com/blog/contrast-through-scale) which is an article about the importance of contrast in typography which can be created by [scale](http://type-scale.com) ,weight, case and colour. These are all better when used collectively but have to be used in the right quantity much like a cocktail needs the right balance of alcohol. This journal also highlights the need to research your target audience and see what will work best for them.

Having books in the 14th century was seen as a sign of wealth and knowledge because of how expensive they were and how long it look to write one out. This was all about to change with the invention of movable type.

In our class today we changed our [GitHub personal page](http://aineoh.github.io) bio and avatar. It was interesting learning how to use images already online on my GitHub page. I also had alot of fun writing about myself as I never knew how many things I could use in a bio. To help myself I researched different bio's by designers and illustrators that I really like such as [Gemma Correll](http://www.gemmacorrell.com/about-me-faqs/), [Jessica Hische](http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer), [Valfre](http://valfre.com/pages/about-us) and [Kate Moross](http://www.katemoross.com/ABOUT). 

This is my personal page:

Week 3 
------

This week we looked at Gutenberg and the revolution of printing. It was created by the Chinese in 1040 AD and made it was across Europe where [Johannes Gutenberg](http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/homepage.html) invented an improved version which is still used today. 

![gutenburg](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Gutenberg_Bible.jpg)

We looked at how a typeface can brand a company and set a different tone of voice. It is very important for designers to know about how different typefaces can set a certain tone for a company. This works well with target audience research as it helps shape a company. 

![fonts](http://i.imgur.com/i7sG3ou.jpg)

We were also put into groups for our presentations and we worked out times were we can all get together and work.

We put a background to our [personal GitHub page](https://aineoh.github.io). My background is my arrow line drawings. I chose this background as its simple enough to not take away from my bio and also placed in the corner so it isn't clashing with my bio.


Week 4 
------

This week we looked at different art movements of the last two centuries. I love learning about art history and really enjoyed this lecture. A few of my favourite artists were mentioned also which was a bonus. 

We started off at the industrial revolution and its influence on artists, architecture and design. <b>Japonism</b> was a big influence of this time. It was a taking the flat Japonese style in disciplines like painting and sculpture. The first artist to incorporate this style were Van Gogh and [Toulouse-Lautrec](http://www.toulouse-lautrec-foundation.org)

![lautrecposter](http://www.toulouse-lautrec-foundation.org/71335/La-Troupe-De-Mlle-Eglantine-large.jpg)

We also learned about the arts and crafts movement which was a anti-industrial revolution movement. This movement focused on nature and kept things simple. There wasn't alot of decoration to the art work. 

Art nouveau was an art movement that used the same principles as arts and crafts but had more flamboyant decoration. One of my favourite artists of this time is [Aubrey Beardsley](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/aubrey-beardsley-716). His work is inspired by simple Japanese art but added very light details details. His work was mostly black and white and had alot of contrast. 

![Aubrey Beardsley](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Beardsley-peacockskirt.PNG)

Two groups of artists we looked at were [The Glasgow School of Art](http://www.gsa.ac.uk) and [Vienna Succession](http://www.theviennasecession.com). In the Glasgow school of art we looked at [Rennie Macintosh](http://www.crmsociety.com) and his role in art, architecture and design. 
In the Vienna Succession my favourite artist is [Gustav Klimt](http://www.klimt.com). I love his elaboratly decorated painting and the detail in them.

Week 5 
------

After the art nouveau movement in Europe there was a different approach to art. The art world was embracing the new industry of machines and speed and this reflected in artists of this time which as called [futurism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism).

A competition was held in 1906, when art nouveau movement was at the height of its time, Priester Match Company held a competition for a promotional poster. They thought they were getting entries with richly decorative art when they recieved an entry by Lucian Bernhard which had a minimalist approach. This started a new movement of minimal design called Plakatstil. This was used in political posters and propaganda in ww1.

![Poster](http://hogd.pbworks.com/f/1255251902/73209-004-77C18F2C.jpg)

Futurism looked at speed, machinery and violence. It used painting, sculpture, architecture, peotry and photography. The work reflected the struggle of the times (war) and how people seen their own stuggles. Typography was used in a different way in this movement to convey stress and struggle.

![poster](http://paperarch.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/umberto_boccioni_-_charge_of_the_lancers.jpg)

Dada was an anti art movement in many ways as it questioned alot of art that came before it. It was a revolt against the culture and values which - it was believed - had caused and supported the carnage of The First World War. The main leaders were typically very young and in their early twenties.

![dada](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Theo_van_Doesburg_kleine_Dada_soirée.jpg)

[Art Deco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco) was a style mainly associated with 1920's and spread internationally. It combined the structure of the industrial age with the tradition art and crafts themes. It was very bold, geometric and rich. Art deco embraced the new technology and was used in old hollywood movies, architecture, product design and fashion. Artist A.M. Cassandre was the most prominent figure of this time.

Week 6 
------
The Russian Revolution and The Bauhaus generate visual vocabularies which still influence design today.

De Stijl was an art movement developed from the breakdown of different things to show the basic shapes. For example a cow would be broken down to rectangles and made really simple.The founders of this movement were Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian and they developed their minimal, geometric abstract style could not be identified by any single country and has been used in fashion, interior design and textiles. 

![homer](http://i.imgur.com/Ok88hHk.png) 

Theo van Doesburg looked at how things can be reduced to basic shapes. He looked at the shape of a cow and how it can be reduced to basic shapes and then form a new way of making art. 

![theo](http://lonelyautodidact.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/4-stages-of-cow.png)

This week we did our first group presentations. Ours was on the pioneers of digital design and we had been getting together as a group for the past two weeks so we were prepared and had practiced our presentation. 

Constructivism
--------------
Constructivist movement began in Russia in 1919. This movement changed how we look at art, instead of asthetics it was used for social purposes. It had an influence on modern art, particularl [Bauhaus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus) 

[El Lissitzky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Lissitzky) was a Russian artist, designer and typographer whose work has freatly influenced Bauhaus and was an important figure in Russian design. His work was used for Russian propaganda. His use of photography and type was a revolution in design

![El Lissitzky](http://uploads2.wikiart.org/images/el-lissitzky/four-arithmetic-actions-1928.jpg)

[Alexander Rodchenko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Rodchenko) was another Russian artist and designer prolific in the construstivist movement. He liked to use different angles in his photography to capture unusual poses and positions.

Bauhaus
-------
The Bauhaus school began in 1919, founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar. It was founded with the idea that all art form could come together and be learned under one roof. It was one of the most influential schools of art of its time. The Bauhaus had a profound influence upon subsequent developments in art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design, and typography.

>Bauhaus Manifesto

>“The ultimate goal of all art is the building! The ornamentation of the building was once the main purpose of the >visual arts, and they were considered indispensable parts of the great building. Today, they exist in complacent >isolation, from which they can only be salvaged by the purposeful and cooperative endeavours of all artisans. >Architects, painters and sculptors must learn a new way of seeing and understanding the composite character of >the building, both as a totality and in terms of its parts. Their work will then re-imbue itself with the spirit >of architecture, which it lost in salon art.

>The art schools of old were incapable of producing this unity – and how could they, for art may not be taught. >They must return to the workshop. This world of mere drawing and painting of draughtsmen and applied artists must >at long last become a world that builds. When a young person who senses within himself a love for creative >endeavour begins his career, as in the past, by learning a trade, the unproductive “artist” will no longer be >condemned to the imperfect practice of art because his skill is now preserved in craftsmanship, where he may >achieve excellence.

>Architects, sculptors, painters – we all must return to craftsmanship! For there is no such thing as “art by >profession”. There is no essential difference between the artist and the artisan. The artist is an exalted >artisan. Merciful heaven, in rare moments of illumination beyond man’s will, may allow art to blossom from the >work of his hand, but the foundations of proficiency are indispensable to every artist. This is the original >source of creative design.

>So let us therefore create a new guild of craftsmen, free of the divisive class pretensions that endeavoured to >raise a prideful barrier between craftsmen and artists! Let us strive for, conceive and create the new building >of the future that will unite every discipline, architecture and sculpture and painting, and which will one day >rise heavenwards from the million hands of craftsmen as a clear symbol of a new belief to come."

![bauhaus](https://bauhausgraphics.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/a4-bauhaus-invite.jpg)

[Laszlo Moholy-Nagy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/László_Moholy-Nagy)was the new head of the preliminary school Moholy-Nagy explored painting, photography, film, sculpture and graphic design. His love for photography and typography developed an interest in the Bauhaus for visual communications. Like Rodchenko he explored photography by experimenting with different viewpoints with extreme close-ups and angled viewpoints. He thought photography would replace art.

Week 7 
------

During World War II the armies forced most influential designers to flee to the safety of the US. [Modernism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism) was formed through western society and it as a socially progressive trend of thought that affirms the power of human beings to create, improve and reshape their environment with the aid of practical experimentation, scientific knowledge, or technology. From this perspective, Modernism encouraged the re-examination of every aspect of existence, from commerce to philosophy, with the goal of finding that which was 'holding back' progress, and replacing it with new ways of reaching the same end. 

Some of the difining characteristics of modernism are:

* Reject traditional forms and decorative elements
* Seek a solution that is simple and direct
* Use systematic methods rather than intuitive ones
* Think about relationships in form and content
* Use geometric shapes: circle, triangle, square
* Use primary colours
* 8 Use sans serif typefaces
* Show contrast in typographical material
* Use photographs and photomontage rather than drawings or illustrations
* Use silhouetted photographs with white backgrounds
* Use maps and diagrams
* Use graphic symbols and icons
* Use of asymmetric page layout
* Use of grid or clearly delineated page-organising method
* Apply a planned visual hierarchy
* A brief look at degenerate art showed how Adolf Hitler persecuted modern artists, designers, musicians, basicially anyone who didn't conform to his ideals.

As artist fleed Europe for the safety of distant shores, many moved to the US where they could practise art freely. The move saw a cultural shift of creativity and intellect from Europe to the States.

![modernist](http://www.georgetowner.com/media/images/derivatives/article_2948-003.jpg)

[The Ulm School of Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulm_School_of_Design) sought to redress the balance in Europe. It is the the second most influencial design school after Bauhaus. it was founded by [Inge Aicher-Scholl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inge_Scholl), [Otl Aicher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otl_Aicher) and [Max Bill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Bill).


The style developed in this school was also known as The Swiss Style, which originated in Switzerland in the 1950s and remained a major movement in design for over 20 years and is Still influencing designers. 

Due to the shift in location by many artists at this time, they were eggar to learn about modernism due to is earlier rejection in Europe. it then made a lasting effect on many artists now in the USA.

![moderist image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Bluemner-Form_and_Light.jpg)

The main designers of American modernism were [Oscar Florianus Bluemner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Florianus_Bluemner), [Patrick Henry Bruce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Henry_Bruce) and [Alfred Henry Maurer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Henry_Maurer).

Week 8 
------
This week we attended Break conference

Week 9 
------
Today we learned about the postmodern movement. This movement started with [Wolfgang Weingart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Weingart) who changed the restrictive rules of typesetting and experimented with type and posters. His work was very heavily influenced by constructivism and looked at how weight and type and pushed the limits of readability. 

![weingart](http://immbudden.com/blog/images/blog/wolfgang.png)

Dan Friedman studied under Weingart at Ulm and had an abstract and simplified structure.

April Grieman was the first graphic designer to use computor graphics.

I-D magazine took a post modern approach and was for youth. It was used as a way to get in touch with music, fashion and design.

Barney bubbles focused on the music scene. He created a lot of album covers with a very mixed style. He appropriated a lot of material and made it his own but liked to jump from style to style. 

Jamie Reid created the sex pistols album.

Peter Saville done album covers for joy division.

Vaughan Oliver made very dreamy art work for album covers.

Russell Mills worked on the edges of design.

Nelville Brody studied in London. He focused on type and liked to experiment with type and layout. His work was abstract and liked to fuse fonts.

David Carson was from America. He didn't have any qualifications as a designer. His magazine was very hard to read so it was open to interpretation from people.
