Design journal for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1 
------
This week we had a broad look at the module and what will be covered in this semester. We looked at how past designs have influence the designs of today. For example [Dieter Rams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams) developed product designs for radios in 1950's which influenced [Jonathon Ive's](https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html)  design for the Ipod. I research this when I left the lecture and found a video called [Everything is a Remix](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/) which shows the history of how everything from music to cinematography is influence by the past. 

We were told about [Refresh](http://refreshbelfast.com) which is in Belfast and a talk is being given by [Brendan Dawes](http://brendandawes.com)

One of our projects for this semester is to design a type tile 3x3 grid of different typefaces from different periods in history that have appealed to me. This is part of our submission for this module. I'm excited for this project as I really enjoy typography and love finding new and old typefaces. 

In our first week on the course we looked at the program [Atom](https://atom.io) and were told to familiarise ourselves with markdown and the syntax for it. To do this we were asked to render a text file in markdown using the Atom program. This was different as I have always used HTML to write code but using markdown was alot easier to do.

Week 2
------
We started this lecture by looking at cave paintings and early written language. We looked at the earliest markings at Cantabria and how the oldest known marking is a simple red dot. This relates to the work we are doing in our modules of interaction design fundamentals which we are learning about points. We learned how cave drawings were inspiration for artists such as Picasso. They also remind me of the work of [Basquiat](http://basquiat.com). 

We learned about the [golden ratio](http://www.creativebloq.com/design/designers-guide-golden-ratio-12121546)and how its used in everything from [architecture](http://www.goldennumber.net/architecture/) to [nature](http://io9.com/5985588/15-uncanny-examples-of-the-golden-ratio-in-nature)
