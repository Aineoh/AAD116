Design journal for Introduction to Communication Design

Week 1 
------
This week we had a broad look at the module and what will be covered in this semester. We looked at how past designs have influence the designs of today. For example [Dieter Rams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams) developed product designs for radios in 1950's which influenced [Jonathon Ive's](https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html)  design for the Ipod. I research this when I left the lecture and found a video called [Everything is a Remix](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/) which shows the history of how everything from music to cinematography is influence by the past. 

We were told about [Refresh](http://refreshbelfast.com) which is in Belfast and a talk is being given by [Brendan Dawes](http://brendandawes.com)

One of our projects for this semester is to design a type tile 3x3 grid of different typefaces from different periods in history that have appealed to me. This is part of our submission for this module. I'm excited for this project as I really enjoy typography and love finding new and old typefaces. When we have collected our images we should have something that looks like this:

In our first week on the course we looked at the program [Atom](https://atom.io) and were told to familiarise ourselves with markdown and the syntax for it. To do this we were asked to render a text file in markdown using the Atom program. This was different as I have always used HTML to write code but using markdown was alot easier to do.

Week 2
------
We started this lecture by looking at cave paintings and early written language. We looked at the earliest markings at Cantabria and how the oldest known marking is a simple red dot. This relates to the work we are doing in our modules of interaction design fundamentals which we are learning about points. We learned how cave drawings were inspiration for artists such as Picasso. They also remind me of the work of [Basquiat](http://basquiat.com).

We learned about the [golden ratio](http://www.creativebloq.com/design/designers-guide-golden-ratio-12121546) and how its used in everything from [architecture](http://www.goldennumber.net/architecture/) to [nature](http://io9.com/5985588/15-uncanny-examples-of-the-golden-ratio-in-nature). We learned how it can be used in design with web design and layout which provides a natural and eye catching result. I found a website that helps you discover the perfect type size for your website using the measurments and calculations of the golden ratio. This will come in useful for designing websites in the future and also for project layouts.

This week we also finished up a homework assignment on markdown. We were given a piece of text and told to use a program called [Atom](https://atom.io) to render it. This was my finished assignment: 


###Ireland's rugged coastline###

Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada
=======================================

###by Robert St'enuit###

####*Illustrations by National Geographic Photographer Bates Lilttlehales*####


A wild north wind lashed the galleass as she sailed eastward across the top of 
Ireland. A monstrous wave had smashed her jury rudder; now she yawed and rolled 
in the troughs, making relentless leeway toward night-hidden cliffs to 
starboard.


>'93In 1588 a ship of the Spanish Armada, the Girona was wrecked with the loss
  of almost all her company at a little cove near the Giants Causeway still 
  called Port na Spaniagh, '91the port of the Spaniards'

Ahead, not thirty miles away, lay Scotland's west coast and sanctuary for the
  vessels company, survivors of Spain's once arrogant Armada. A few more miles 
  and the Girona would be clear of Ireland; a few more hours would make good an 
  escape begun nearly three months before. Oarsmen battled the wind with 
  flailing sweeps, struggling vainly to steer the ship away from the shore.
  
The wind won. White water boiled off the starboard bow. A scream from the 
lookout brought sailors racing to drop anchor. Too late. A fang of rock rising
  from the sea ripped the Girona's flank; she gutted herself upon it. Her back
  broke, her side opened, her entrails burst from her. Cannons, cannon balls, 
  small arms, stores, coffers and 1,300 sick men, too exhausted to struggle, 
  sank into the convulsive surf. 
  
**Four centuries later the shipwreck was discovered under 30 feet of icy water, 
treasures lost on that fateful day included:**

* A ornamental winged salamander 
* Gold cross of the Knight of Malta 
* Gilded brass dolphin 
* Lapis lazuli cameos 
* Silver sculpture of a grotesque face. 
* Gold ducats


** The Author:** Veteran Belgin dicer Robert St'enuit spent two days at 432 feet 
beneath the sea in a pioneering test he described in **'93The Deepest Days'94**, National Geographic, April 1965. Here he tells the dramatic story of finding the Girona.


I also looked at [contrast through scale](http://typecast.com/blog/contrast-through-scale) which is an article about the importance of contrast in typography which can be created by [scale](http://type-scale.com) ,weight, case and colour. These are all better when used collectively but have to be used in the right quantity much like a cocktail needs the right balance of alcohol. This journal also highlights the need to research your target audience and see what will work best for them.

Having books in the 14th century was seen as a sign of wealth and knowledge because of how expensive they were and how long it look to write one out. This was all about to change with the invention of movable type.

In our class today we changed our [GitHub personal page](http://aineoh.github.io) bio and avatar. It was interesting learning how to use images already online on my GitHub page. I also had alot of fun writing about myself as I never knew how many things I could use in a bio. To help myself I researched different bio's by designers and illustrators that I really like such as [Gemma Correll](http://www.gemmacorrell.com/about-me-faqs/), [Jessica Hische](http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer), [Valfre](http://valfre.com/pages/about-us) and [Kate Moross](http://www.katemoross.com/ABOUT). 

This is my personal page:

Week 3 
------

This week we looked at Gutenberg and the revolution of printing. It was created by the Chinese in 1040 AD and made it was across Europe where [Johannes Gutenberg](http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/homepage.html) invented an improved version which is still used today.

We looked at how a typeface can brand a company and set a different tone of voice. It is very important for designers to know about how different typefaces can set a certain tone for a company. This works well with target audience research as it helps shape a company.

We were also put into groups for our presentations and we worked out times were we can all get together and work.

We put a background to our [personal GitHub page](https://aineoh.github.io). My background is my arrow line drawings. I chose this background as its simple enough to not take away from my bio and also placed in the corner so it isn't clashing with my bio.
